This set of spicy home-fermented hot sauces will bring liberal tears to your eyes and flavorful heat to your favorite foods.  Donated for the 2023 Roosevelt-Hamer fundraising dinner to help raise funds for the Santa Barbara Democratic Party!

#### Fatalii Fuyu

A little sweetness from Fuyu persimmons and intense citrusy spice from aptly-named Fatalii peppers.  

#### Tabasco 2.0

Densely packed with punchy Tabasco peppers - much hotter than the store-bought stuff!

#### Plum Habanero

Plum tartness softens the kick from an assortment of habanero varieties.
